600 years of astronomy, mapped ✨
From Ulugh Beg's 15th-century observatory in Samarkand (whose star catalog remained unmatched for 200 years) to Maidanak Observatory discovering 80+ asteroids today — Uzbekistan's astronomical heritage is written both on Earth and in space.
Celestial namesakes include:
🌙 Ulugh Beigh lunar crater
🪨 Asteroids: (2439) Ulugbek, (1381) Uzbekistania, (2170271) Samarkand
Five observatories. Centuries of stargazing. One legacy.
