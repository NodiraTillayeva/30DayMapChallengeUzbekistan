Korzinka supermarkets in Tashkent 🛒


Author: Tumaris Ramanova



Created a quick map showing Korzinka supermarkets in Tashkent - the city’s most popular supermarket chain! I used data from OSM and visualized it in carto.com . Each supermarket is represented with a shopping cart icon 🛒, making it easy to see the distribution of Korzinka across the city. It’s a fun way to turn simple point data into a visual story!
