Day 3: Polygons | #30DayMapChallenge 

For today’s theme, I compared Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) changes in Karakalpakstan between 2017 and 2024.

Using Sentinel-2 10-meter LULC imagery, I processed and visualized the data in ArcGIS Pro. The comparison shows that crop, flooded vegetation, and water areas have decreased over time and of course the most visible changes near the Aral Sea. 

Data: Sentinel-2

Tool: ArcGIS Pro
