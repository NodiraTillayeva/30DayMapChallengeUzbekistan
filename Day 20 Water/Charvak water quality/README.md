Day 20: Water- Charvak Reservoir Chlorophyll map (NDCI)

Author: Tumaris Ramanova

Created a map of Charvak Reservoir using 2024 Sentinel-2 imagery in Google Earth Engine to estimate chlorophyll levels (NDCI). Using NDWI to mask out land, I focused on water areas and calculated (Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index) NDCI to measure algae growth. I made composites for the full year and June–December to capture seasonal changes, visualized as a color-coded map:

🔹 Blue areas → low chlorophyll (cleaner water)

🔹 Yellow areas → moderate algae

🔹 Red areas → high algae, indicating possible water quality concerns


Chlorophyll concentration in water tells us a lot about algae growth and overall ecological health of lakes and reservoirs.

Data: Sentinel-2

Tool: Google Earth Engine
