Day 8: Urban - Urban Heat Island 

For today's I created an Urban Heat Island map of Tashkent (2024) using Landsat 9 imagery in ArcGIS Pro.

First, I derived the Land Surface Temperature map from Landsat 9 imagery, then used it to identify UHI zones across Tashkent. This map visualizes how land surface temperature varies across the city. 

Data: USGS, Landsat 9
Tool: ArcGIS Pro
