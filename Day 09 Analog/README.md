Day 9: Analog |

For today’s theme, I created a hand drawn physical map of Karakalpakstan. 

It’s not a perfect map, but I really enjoyed the process. Sometimes it’s nice to take a break from digital tools and just draw by hand.
I used colored pencils to show natural features like rivers, elevation, and borders. It reminded me how much patience and creativity traditional cartographers needed before GIS existed!


Data: Physical maps
