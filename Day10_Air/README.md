Day 10: Air | 

For today’s theme “Air”, I decided to visualize atmospheric NO₂ concentration across Uzbekistan using Sentinel-5P (TROPOMI) satellite data in Google Earth Engine.

NO₂ is one of the major indicators of air pollution, mainly emitted from vehicles, industrial activities, and fossil fuel combustion. This map shows spatial variation of NO₂ levels with higher concentrations over urban and industrial regions.

Data can tell so much about our environment! 


Data: Sentinel- 5P
Tool: Google Earth Engine
