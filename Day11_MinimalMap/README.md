Day 11: Minimal Map |

For today’s theme, I created a minimalist map of Nukus city.
The map includes only essential urban features: roads, waterways, and the city boundary extracted from OpenStreetMap via Overpass Turbo.
I visualized and cleaned the data in QGIS, then styled it in Canva for a simple, balanced look.

Data : OSM

Tool: QGIS, Canva
