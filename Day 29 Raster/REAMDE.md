🌊 Day 29 — Raster
30 Day Map Challenge 2025

For today’s Raster theme, I mapped the dramatic transformation of the Aral Sea between 1985 and 2024 using Landsat imagery in Google Earth Engine.

The visualization compares water extent across decades, highlights shoreline change, and uses raster-based edge detection to emphasize the shrinking boundaries.

Data:
Landsat 5 TM (1985)
Landsat 8 OLI (2024)
Google Earth Engine


Story:
Once the world’s 4th largest lake, the Aral Sea has lost over 90% of its surface area—an environmental catastrophe clearly visible through remote sensing.
