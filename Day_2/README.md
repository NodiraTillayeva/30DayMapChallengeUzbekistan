#30DayMapChallenge | Day 2 - Lines

Quick and simple map for today!
For today’s theme, I focused on Karakalpakstan’s transportation network in northwestern Uzbekistan 🇺🇿

This map visualizes the region’s railways, national highways, and local roads.
All datasets were obtained from OpenStreetMap (via Overpass Turbo) and processed in QGIS. Layers were clipped to the Karakalpakstan boundary for a clearer view of the network.

🗺️ Theme: Lines

📍 Region: Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan
