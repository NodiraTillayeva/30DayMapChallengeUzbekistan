🗺️ Day 1 — Points | 30 Day Map Challenge 2025

This repository contains the map for Day 1: Points of my #30DayMapChallenge
 journey.

📍 Map Theme

Topic: Points
Title: Free Wi-Fi Zones in Tashkent City

This map visualizes public free Wi-Fi zones across Tashkent City, using open data from gov.uz
.
Each point represents a location where free internet access is available — including shopping centers, parks, markets, and medical centers.

However, not all districts are represented in the dataset — for instance, Yangihayot and Bektemir currently have no listed Wi-Fi zones.

🧰 Tools Used

Kepler.gl
 — for map visualization

CSV data preprocessing (Excel / Google Sheets)

📊 Data Source

Official open dataset: Free Wi-Fi Zones in Uzbekistan — gov.uz

🗂️ Files Included

data/wi_fi_zones_tashkent.csv — point dataset

map_screenshot.png — map visualization preview

README.md — project description

💡 Notes

This was my first map created using Kepler.gl, and I was impressed by its simplicity and visual quality.
The dataset might be updated in the future as more public Wi-Fi zones are added.
