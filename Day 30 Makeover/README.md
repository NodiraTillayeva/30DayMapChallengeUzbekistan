Day 30: MAKEOVER - Aral Sea Environmental Catastrophe Visualization
🌊 Overview
A professionally enhanced visualization of one of Earth's greatest environmental disasters: the shrinking of the Aral Sea from 1984 to 2024. Using 40 years of Landsat satellite imagery, this project creates a stunning timelapse showing the loss of over 90% of the water body.
📊 Key Features
Visual Enhancements

Natural color grading with enhanced teal-blue water tones
3-year median composites for seamless, tile-free imagery
Cloud masking using QA_PIXEL bands for clean composites
NDWI visualization with color-coded water depth gradients
Change detection overlays (lost water, persistent water, regained water)

Technical Capabilities

Multi-sensor support: Landsat 5 (TM), 7 (ETM+), and 8 (OLI)
Surface area calculations using NDWI-based water masking
Time-series analysis with area chart visualization
Frame-by-frame export (41 PNG images for custom timelapse creation)
Interactive legend with professional styling
