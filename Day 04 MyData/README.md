Day 4: My Data | #30DayMapChallenge


For today’s theme, I created an interactive map showing the European cities I’ve visited.
The map was built with Leaflet.js, using OpenStreetMap as the basemap. Each city marker includes coordinates and popups with images.

Creating this map was a fun way to visualize my own travel data and practice web mapping!
